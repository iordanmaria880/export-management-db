# export-management-db

This project creates a fictional export management database to simulate monitoring, organizing, and analyzing international trade. Focused on IT and electronic products (phones, laptops, accessories, gadgets), it includes interconnected tables for products, regions & countries, business partners, orders, transports, border points, and exports. The database demonstrates how centralized and automated information can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and support strategic decision-making.
