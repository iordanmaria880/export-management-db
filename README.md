# export-management-db

This project uses SQL and PL/SQL to create a fictional export management database, simulating the monitoring, organization, and analysis of international trade. Focused on IT and electronic products (phones, laptops, accessories, gadgets), it includes interconnected tables for products, regions & countries, business partners, orders, transports, border points, and exports.

The extended version emphasizes database creation and advanced PL/SQL features, including:

Table creation and data insertion

Control structures, cursors, and exception handling

Procedures and functions

This SQL/PLSQL-based database demonstrates how centralized and automated information can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and support strategic decision-making.

Note: Project documentation is written in Romanian.
