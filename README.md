# export-management-db

This project uses SQL to create a fictional export management database, simulating the monitoring, organization, and analysis of international trade. Focused on IT and electronic products (phones, laptops, accessories, gadgets), it includes interconnected tables for products, regions & countries, business partners, orders, transports, border points, and exports. The database demonstrates how SQL-based centralization and automation improve efficiency, reduce errors, and support strategic decision-making.
