# export-management-db

This project involves the creation of a fictional database for export management, aimed at simulating the processes of monitoring, organizing, and analyzing international trade.

The database is primarily focused on the export of IT and electronic products (phones, laptops, accessories, and gadgets) and includes several interconnected tables, such as:

Products – details about the exported goods;

Regions & Countries – export locations and commercial headquarters;

Business Partners – information about external collaborators;

Orders – links between partners and exported products;

Transports – data on delivery methods and timelines;

Border Points – transit zones between countries;

Exports (central table) – correlates orders, products, transports, and headquarters.

This structure demonstrates how automation and centralization of information can enhance the efficiency of export processes, reduce human errors, and support strategic decision-making.
